                    <h4>REDFLOW Terms &amp; Privacy Policy</h4>
                    <p>Last updated: September 2026</p>
                    <p>Welcome to REDFLOW: A Community Blood Donation Blood Types Digital Master List in Irosin, Sorsogon. Please read these Terms and this Privacy Policy carefully. By creating an account, logging in, or using REDFLOW, you agree to them. If you do not agree, please do not use the system.</p>

                    <h4>1. What REDFLOW Is</h4>
                    <p>REDFLOW is a web-based information and coordination system for authorized Staff and Administrators. It keeps an organized digital master list of voluntary blood donors, their blood types, their donation history, and related records, so that community blood donation information is easier to manage and find.</p>
                    <p>REDFLOW is a record-keeping and coordination tool only. It is not a hospital, a blood bank, a laboratory, or a medical service, and it does not diagnose, treat, screen, or decide who may donate or receive blood.</p>

                    <h4>2. Who May Use REDFLOW</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>REDFLOW is only for authorized Staff and Administrators. You must be at least 18 years old to create an account.</li>
                        <li>A new Staff account stays &ldquo;Pending&rdquo; until an Administrator reviews your sign-up information, valid ID, and selfie, and approves it. An Administrator may reject a request if the information is incomplete, unclear, or cannot be verified.</li>
                        <li>You must give true, complete, and current information when you sign up and keep it up to date.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>3. Your Account and Security</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are responsible for your account and for everything done under it. Do not share your email or password with anyone, and log out when you use a shared device.</li>
                        <li>Passwords must be at least 8 characters and include numbers and symbols.</li>
                        <li>For your protection, after 5 wrong login attempts your account is temporarily locked for 60 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Resetting a forgotten password and changing your password both require a 6-digit verification code sent to your registered email address. The code expires after 10 minutes and can be used only once.</li>
                        <li>Tell an Administrator right away if you think someone else has used your account.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>4. Information We Collect</h4>
                    <p><strong>Account information:</strong> your full name, email address, contact number, sex, birthday, address or barangay, role (Staff or Administrator), and password. Your password is never stored as plain text.</p>
                    <p><strong>Verification documents:</strong> the photo of the front and back of your valid ID and your selfie, submitted only to confirm your identity when you sign up for a Staff account.</p>
                    <p><strong>Donor information entered by authorized users:</strong> a donor&rsquo;s name, blood type, contact number, sex, birthday, barangay or address, weight, eligibility status, allergies, medical conditions, deferral reason, emergency contact name and number, and donation history (donation dates, number of times donated, and amount).</p>
                    <p><strong>Activity information:</strong> when you log in and log out, failed login attempts, your IP address at login, your notifications, and Audit Log entries showing who created, updated, deleted, or exported a donor record and when.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technical information:</strong> session cookies that keep you logged in, and browser storage that keeps a working copy of your data on the device you use. REDFLOW may also load fonts and icons from third-party content delivery networks.</p>
                    <p>REDFLOW does <strong>not</strong> use GPS or live location tracking, does not process payments, does not show advertisements, and does not sell personal information.</p>

                    <h4>5. How We Use Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To keep the donor master list and history records, and to help authorized personnel find donors by blood type and barangay for legitimate blood donation coordination.</li>
                        <li>To verify and approve Staff accounts and to manage who has access.</li>
                        <li>To protect the system and the people in it: login security, account lockout, and the Audit Log that records who did what.</li>
                        <li>To send you verification codes by email when you reset or change your password.</li>
                        <li>To show summary statistics such as Monthly Donations and Blood Type Availability, and to send in-app notifications about your account and system activity.</li>
                        <li>To meet legal, institutional, and research requirements, where they apply.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Personal information is not used for unrelated purposes such as advertising, marketing, selling, harassment, or discrimination.</p>

                    <h4>6. How We Protect Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Passwords are stored only in a scrambled (hashed) form that cannot be turned back into the original password.</li>
                        <li>Donor names, contact numbers, blood types, and related donor and record details are encrypted (AES-256) in the database. Your ID and selfie photos are also stored encrypted.</li>
                        <li>Information travels between your browser and the server over a secure (HTTPS) connection.</li>
                        <li>Only logged-in, approved users can open donor data. Administrators have extra controls that Staff do not have, and the Audit Log keeps a record of important actions for accountability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>No system can be made 100% secure. We use reasonable organizational and technical safeguards, and we ask every user to do their part by protecting their own account.</p>

                    <h4>7. Who Can See Information</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approved Staff and Administrators can view donor and record information needed for their work.</li>
                        <li>Only Administrators can review sign-up requests, including the ID and selfie you submitted, and manage user accounts.</li>
                        <li>We do not sell or rent personal information. We share it only when needed for legitimate blood donation coordination with authorized health personnel, or when required by law.</li>
                        <li>Verification emails are delivered through a third-party email service. Only your email address and the verification code are sent to it for delivery.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>8. Third-Party Services</h4>
                    <p>REDFLOW depends on a few outside services to work:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a cloud hosting provider that runs the website and stores the database;</li>
                        <li>an email delivery service that sends your verification codes (it receives only your email address and the code, so the email can be delivered); and</li>
                        <li>content delivery networks (Google Fonts and Font Awesome) that load the fonts and icons you see on screen. When your browser loads them, they may receive basic technical data such as your IP address.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These services have their own terms and privacy policies. Donor information is never shared with them for advertising or any purpose unrelated to running REDFLOW.</p>

                    <h4>9. Cookies and Browser Storage</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>session cookie</strong> keeps you logged in and ends after a period of inactivity or when you log out.</li>
                        <li>A <strong>security (CSRF) token</strong> protects your requests from being forged by other websites.</li>
                        <li><strong>Browser local storage</strong> keeps a working copy of the donor list, records, and notifications on the device you use, so pages load faster. It is refreshed from the server and stays on the device until it is replaced or you clear your browser data, so avoid using REDFLOW on public or shared devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>REDFLOW does not use advertising or tracking cookies.</p>

                    <h4>10. How Long We Keep Information</h4>
                    <p>We keep information only as long as it is needed for the purposes above. Administrators may delete donor records, history records, and user accounts. When a sign-up request is rejected, or an account is deleted, the ID and selfie stored for that account are deleted with it. Audit Log entries may be kept for accountability.</p>

                    <h4>11. Your Data Privacy Rights (Republic Act No. 10173)</h4>
                    <p>REDFLOW follows the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173) and its principles of transparency, legitimate purpose, and proportionality. Because a person&rsquo;s blood type and health-related details are sensitive personal information, they are handled with extra care. Under the law you have the right to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>be informed about how your personal data is collected and used;</li>
                        <li>access your personal data;</li>
                        <li>object to processing, and give or withdraw your consent;</li>
                        <li>correct inaccurate or outdated data;</li>
                        <li>request the removal or blocking of your data, where allowed by law;</li>
                        <li>receive a copy of your data in a usable format;</li>
                        <li>be compensated for damages caused by unlawful use of your data; and</li>
                        <li>file a complaint with the National Privacy Commission.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To use any of these rights, contact the REDFLOW Administrator.</p>

                    <h4>12. Acceptable Use</h4>
                    <p>You agree that you will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>use REDFLOW only for legitimate community blood donation coordination and administration;</li>
                        <li>enter accurate, verified information and avoid duplicate or outdated records;</li>
                        <li>keep donor information confidential and never copy, export, share, or post it without authorization;</li>
                        <li>never use donor information to harass, threaten, discriminate against, advertise to, or profit from anyone; and</li>

Screening, blood typing, compatibility testing, and transfusion decisions must always be done by qualified healthcare professionals at authorized facilities.</p>

                    <h4>14. Suspension and Termination</h4>
                    <p>An Administrator may suspend, restrict, or remove an account that breaks these Terms, puts donor information or the system at risk, or was created with false information. You may stop using REDFLOW at any time and may ask an Administrator to delete your account. Deleting an account also deletes the ID and selfie stored for it.</p>
